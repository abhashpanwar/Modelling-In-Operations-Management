### The dataset source as Follows :
https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales

### The paper we are following : 
- Ali Fallah Tehrani and Diane Ahrens, "Improved Forecasting and Purchasing of Fashion Products based on the Use of Big Data Techniques"
- A.L.D. Loureiro "Exploring the use of deep neural networks for sales forecasting in fashion retail"

# Objective:
To forecast the sale of a store and optimize it wrt the market demand. Since store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality and many more.
# Goal: 
- Explore the data (handle missing values etc).
- Analysis per store type and correlational analysis of stores’ activity.
- To define the actual relationship between variables and their associated demand patterns.
- Perform Time Series Analysis (MA, ARIMA, SARIMAX),Machine Learning(Lasso Regression and Random Forest)and Deep learning(Feedforward Neural Network with backpropagation) models.
